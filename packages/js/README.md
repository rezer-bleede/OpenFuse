# JavaScript Packages

This directory hosts shared TypeScript/JavaScript libraries published to npm for use in the web application and external integrations.

- `sdk/` – browser-friendly API clients
- `ui/` – shared design system components
- `config/` – ESLint, Prettier, and shared tooling configs

Add packages using `pnpm` workspaces once the monorepo tooling is configured.
